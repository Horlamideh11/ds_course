We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.
Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!
Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.
Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.
Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.
Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.
Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.
Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.
Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazons EMR would also be an asset.
Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.
GitHub
All of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.
JIRA
IZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.

Software Developer/Data Engineer/Platform Administrator,-1,"Your Opportunity:
In Corporate Risk Management we provide an integrated risk management strategy that supports the delivery of predictable financial and operational performance in order to produce successful client and shareholder outcomes. We are organized around six primary functions: Enterprise Risk; Credit, Market, and Investment Risk; Information Security Risk; Model Risk; Operational Risk; and Financial Crimes Risk.
What you are good at:
You will work in Financial Crimes Risk Management (FCRM), one of the six primary Risk Management functions at Schwab. Among other things, this team manages the risk of loss in Money Movement services offered through Schwab Bank and Brokerage affiliates.

More specifically, you will join the (FDP) Fraud Data Platforms Department, within Financial Crimes Risk Management. FDP is primarily responsible for:
Fraud Prevention Data
Fraud Prevention Platforms/Technology
As a Fraud Data Engineer for the FDP department, you will primarily perform four duties:
Data Engineering; Collaborating, sourcing, ingesting, redefining, storing, curating, querying and preparing data
Application Development; Write original code to develop SQL Server Objects and .NET GUI enhancements
Data Platform Administration; Includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory administration
Data Platform Migration; Potentially migrating homegrown data applications to Enterprise support.
It is very important to note that although this is a technical position, it is on the Business side of Schwab and not on the Technology side of the company. This means you act as your own Business Analyst, and you are confident interacting with many different partners both in-person, and through technology. In other words, you are first and foremost a Cyber, Risk and Fraud Professional who protects our clients from crime. Secondarily you are a skilled Technologist who also understands the importance of tech administration.

It is also important to note that early on you will primarily work in a Microsoft Stack environment; specifically in SQL Server, Visual Studio and as a .NET UI Developer. As our department and therefore our technology progresses, you may be spending more time in Big Data environments such as Hadoop, or Cloud environments such as GCP or AWS. This transition will take time, but it is important to have an interest in updating your skills as required.

Data Engineering:
You are an experienced Data Engineer and .NET UI Developer working as an individual contributor and self-reliant decision maker. However, although your business title is “Data Engineer,” you are a Tech Generalist with a broad background in several areas including: Software Engineer/Developer, Systems Engineer, Release Engineer, and Data/Systems Architect. Additionally, and as needed, you will play an active role as your own Production Support for fraud prevention applications, primarily in the
Microsoft Stack.

Responsibilities include assessing business partner data needs, then sourcing, ingesting, redefining, blending, automating, storing, querying and preparing those data to meet analytical or reporting needs. Among other things this may involve contacting vendors as well as internal Schwab departments and product owners, researching data dictionaries and navigating legacy as well as modern data systems. Examples of data assets you may work with include web, client, account, transaction and more. Partners relying on your data create fraud prevention strategies through a range of simple-to-advanced analytics. Among other Risk Management topics, Client Experience and Crime Prevention are central themes, particularly as they relate to money movement channels such as Wire, ACH, Card, Check, Bill Pay, Account Open, etc.

Application Development:
One of our primary applications is currently written in .NET. From time to time you will be asked to write enhancements. Over time this application may get migrated but initially, GUI improvements will be one of your four primary responsibilities.

Data Platform Administration:
Platform administration is foundational to compliance, and being on the business side of technology you will often be your own administrator. This includes but is not limited to application audits, tests, controls, compliance and regulatory paperwork. Financial Services is a regulated industry meaning timely administration is important to our clients and our company.

Data Platform Migration:
As Charles Schwab matures, you may play a role in migrating older, “homegrown” data-tech platforms, supported by you, to enterprise-level platforms developed by you, but supported by Enterprise Technology Services. This transition will take time which means as a Technologist, perseverance is your strength. Like many financial services companies, Schwab is migrating to Big Data and Cloud, but given our responsibility to safely manage our clients’ assets, this change will take time.

Overall Crucial Duties Include:
Improve the Client/Brand experience while helping to minimize financial crimes.
Share responsibility for protecting clients and company from criminal activity such as ID theft, Scams, Synthetic ID, Account Take-Over and New Account Fraud.
Develop technical connections to new data sources such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, Hadoop, NAS drives, weblogs, Hive tables and distributed file systems and applications.
Ingest new data into SQL Server databases.
Build data objects, job flows, code and applications.
Work with vendors and internal and external business partners to acquire new data feeds to advise risk management and fraud prevention activities.
Share technical ownership of the Risk Data infrastructure including databases, data objects, GUIs and job flows.
Modernize, automate, maintain and scale data-related processes and infrastructure.
Move large amounts of data, write original data management and GUI development code, create custom views and data sets.
Store and manage sensitive data in SQL Server and Hadoop.
Regularly deliver ad-hoc data solutions such as simple-to-complex queries and analytic data sets.
Act as your own application administrator and production support.
Develop in a .NET UI environment.
Take an interactive and visible role within your department as well as with business partners.

ABOUT

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world’s information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp’s mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser’s desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable distributed systems.
Design and development of streaming data platforms using Kafka Streams, Spark, Flink, Storm, Beam or Cloud Dataflow.
Experience with functional/event-driven programming.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a DevOps project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.6,"Object Partners

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.
Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

About LogRocket

LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the third grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out toward an audacious goal: to make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.

Our team is a diverse group that brings an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT, and Columbia. We enjoy eating lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our show-and-tell sessions, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship — our engineering blog posts offer a taste of that — and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have important spaces in our lives, whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies, and we're doing all we can to make LogRocket another one.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win.
